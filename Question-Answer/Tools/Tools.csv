What does the -switch_cell argument in PDN do while doing power switch insertion?,"During power switch insertion, the -switch_cell argument is used to specify the name of a coarse-grain power switch cell that is to be inserted wherever the standard cell rail connects to the rest of the power grid. The mesh layers are associated with the unswitched power net of the voltage domain, whereas the standard cell rail is associated with the switched power net of the voltage domain. The placement of a power switch cell connects the unswitched power mesh to the switched power rail through a power switch defined by the define_power_switch_cell command."

What does the -switch_cell argument in PDN do while doing power switch insertion?,"For inserting power switches, the -switch_cell parameter is utilized to denote a coarse-grain power switch cell's name for insertion at points where the standard cell rail merges with the broader power grid. The mesh layers correspond with the voltage domain's unswitched power net, and the standard cell rail links to the switched power net. Inserting a power switch cell bridges the unswitched power mesh and the switched power rail, facilitated by the define_power_switch_cell command."
What does the par module do?,"The partitioning module (par) is based on TritonPart, an open-source constraints-driven partitioner. par can be used to partition a hypergraph or a gate-level netlist. TritonPart solves multi-way partitioning by 1) constraints-driven coarsening, 2) initial partitioning, 3) refinement, 4) cut-overlay clustering and partitioning (COCP), and 5) V-cycle refinement. The purpose of partitioning a netlist is to reduce the complexity of a circuit so that algorithms can operate on smaller chunks of the netlist at a time. Partitioning a netlist may slightly reduce the optimization opportunities compared to a non-partitioned approach, but it greatly benefits the runtime. Partitioning a netlist may be the only option to feasibly operate on very large circuits."

What does the par module do?,"The partitioning tool, par, leverages TritonPart, a freely available constraint-based partitioning software. It enables the partitioning of hypergraphs or gate-level netlists through a process involving constraint-led coarsening, initial partitioning, refinement, cut-overlay clustering and partitioning (COCP), and V-cycle refinement. The main goal is to simplify the circuit's complexity, allowing algorithms to manage smaller sections of the netlist efficiently. Though partitioning may slightly limit optimization chances, it significantly enhances runtime and is often the sole strategy for managing vast circuits."
Is TritonRoute the foundation of drt?,"The Detailed Routing (drt) module in OpenROAD is based on the open-source detailed router TritonRoute. TritonRoute consists of several main building blocks, including pin access analysis, track assignment, initial detailed routing, search and repair, and a DRC engine. The initial development of the router is inspired by the ISPD-2018 initial detailed routing contest. However, the current drt framework differs and is built from scratch, aiming for an industrial-oriented, scalable, and flexible flow."

What are the units of the -pad_right and -pad_left arguments of the global_placement function,"In global_placement, -pad_right and -pad_left add padding which is measured in cell sites to effectively make the cell appear wider. pad_left adds a pad to the left side, pad_right adds it to the right side. Wider cells during global placement can help reduce placement congestion and make finding a valid placement easier."

Does space padding influence the design utilization? I feel like it shouldn't.,"Cell padding only impacts the way the global placer (gpl) and detailed placer (dpl) sees the cells. Cell padding does not change the logic area of the cell from the user perspective. If you were to use the report_design_area command, you would see the unpadded design utilization reported."
"Does padding affect design utilization, in your opinion?","Cell padding only impacts the way the global placer (gpl) and detailed placer (dpl) sees the cells. Cell padding does not change the logic area of the cell from the user perspective. If you were to use the report_design_area command, you would see the unpadded design utilization reported."
Does space padding influence the design utilization? I feel like it shouldn't.,"Padding adjustments affect only how global and detailed placers view the cells, leaving the cell's logical area as perceived by the user unchanged.

"Wouldn't manually adding pads in the global_placement function reduce the maximum design utilization possible for a design? Especially since OpenROAD wants to be automatic, GPL will stop everything if it sees a DU >100% even if it could achieve a reasonable DU with equivalent padding","Cell padding can reduce the maximum possible design utilization. If you don't want padding in your design, you can reduce the default padding or turn it off. However, padding is usually necessary to achieve a cleanly routed design, because cells which are too close together may make routing impossible. If you want to optimize for very high-density designs, I believe you can also set padding on a master-by-master basis so that only the most difficult cells are padded. This process may take some trial and error."

"Wouldn't manually adding pads in the global_placement function reduce the maximum design utilization possible for a design?

Adjusting or disabling default padding is an option, though padding is often crucial for achieving a neatly routed design by preventing overly congested cell placements. For high-density design optimization, padding can be selectively applied to particularly challenging cells, requiring some experimentation."
Why did I encounter an issue with CORE_UTILIZATION when trying to aim for a DU of 70% on the ASAP7 PDK which should be possible and reasonable for any design?,"If you are using ORFS, the CORE_UTILIZATION variable only determines the core utilization after Yosys (synthesis) runs using the netlist data. The utilization can change dramatically as OpenROAD performs timing optimization, which will insert buffers, remove buffers, and resize cells. For example, if you set CORE_UTILIZATION to 70% utilization during the initialization step, you may end up with 90%+ utilization because of optimization to meet timing constraints. It is currently up to the designer to ensure that the CORE_UTILIZATION is set appropriately, which may require some trial and error."

Why did I encounter an issue with CORE_UTILIZATION when trying to aim for a DU of 70% on the ASAP7 PDK which should be possible and reasonable for any design?,"With ORFS, the CORE_UTILIZATION variable reflects core utilization post-Yosys synthesis, based on netlist data. Subsequent timing optimization in OpenROAD, which includes buffer insertion, deletion, and cell resizing, can significantly alter utilization levels. Designers must judiciously set CORE_UTILIZATION, anticipating possible adjustments through trial and error."
"If I have a design for which the detailed placement fails for a few instances, if I relax my timing constraints will it result in a successful placement?","Relaxing timing constraints can usually reduce your design utilization because fewer buffers will need to be inserted.

However, the results may not be identical if the timing constraints are changed."
"Is re-synthesizing with altered timing constraints unnecessary with Yosys, or does it also resize non-buffer cells?","Empirically, applying timing constraints to Yosys for synthesis does not have much impact on the output netlist.

How do I check DRC?,"In OpenROAD, you can use the check_drc command to run the design rule check (DRC).
