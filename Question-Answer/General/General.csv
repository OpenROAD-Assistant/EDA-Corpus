What is PDNGEN?,"The PDNGEN module (pdn) in OpenROAD aims to simplify the process of adding a power grid into a floorplan. A user can specify a small set of power grid policies to be applied to the design, such as the layers to use, stripe width, and spacing, and then pdn will generate the actual metal straps. Power grid policies can be defined over both the standard cell area and areas occupied by macros."

What is PDNGEN?,"OpenROAD's Power Distribution Network Generator (PDNGEN) module, abbreviated as pdn, streamlines the integration of a power grid into a design's floorplan. Users can establish a few power grid guidelines, such as selecting layers, setting stripe width, and spacing, after which pdn automatically constructs the metal straps. These guidelines can be applied across both the standard cell region and macro-occupied areas."

How is FastRoute better than previous routing frameworks?,"FastRoute innovates over prior routing frameworks because it integrates several novel techniques: fast congestion-driven via-aware Steiner tree construction, 3-bend routing, virtual capacity adjustment, multi-source multi-sink maze routing, and spiral layer assignment. These techniques not only address the routing congestion measured at the edges of global routing grids but also minimize the total wirelength and via usage, which is critical for subsequent detailed routing, yield, and manufacturability. Experimental results show that FastRoute is highly effective and efficient in solving ISPD07 and ISPD08 global routing benchmark suites. The results outperform recently published academic global routers in both routability and runtime. In particular, for ISPD07 and ISPD08 global routing benchmarks, FastRoute generates 12 congestion-free solutions out of 16 benchmarks with a speed significantly faster than other routers."

What does RTLMP do?,"A macro placer (MP) is an algorithm which specifically focuses on placing macros in the core area. RTL­MP is a novel macro placer that utilizes RTL information and tries to “mimic” the interaction between the frontend RTL designer and the back­ end physical design engineer to produce human­-quality floorplans. By exploiting the logical hierarchy and processing logical modules based on connection signatures, RTL­MP can capture the dataflow inherent in the RTL and use the dataflow information to guide macro placement."

What was the need to develop Hier-RTLMP?,"Recently, with the increasing complexity of IP blocks, and in particular with auto-generated RTL for machine learning (ML) accelerators, the number of macros in a single RTL block can easily run into several hundred. This makes the task of generating an automatic floorplan (.def) with IO pin and macro placements for front-end physical synthesis even more critical and challenging. The so-called peripheral approach of forcing macros to the periphery of the layout is no longer viable when the ratio of the sum of the macro perimeters to the floorplan perimeter is large since this increases the required stacking depth of macros. Thus, a novel multilevel physical planning approach that exploits the hierarchy and dataflow inherent in the design RTL, and describes its realization in a new hierarchical macro placer, Hier-RTLMP was developed.

What was the need to develop Hier-RTLMP?,"The increasing complexity of IP blocks, especially auto-generated RTL for machine learning (ML) accelerators, has led to designs with hundreds of macros. This escalates the difficulty of automatically generating a floorplan (.def) that includes IO pin and macro placements for front-end physical synthesis. The traditional peripheral placement strategy becomes impractical when the macro perimeter sum greatly exceeds the floorplan's perimeter, necessitating a novel multilevel physical planning approach. This approach, realized in the Hier-RTLMP, leverages design RTL's inherent hierarchy and data flow for effective macro placement."

How does FastRoute work?,"The first part of the FastRoute framework is topology generation. Because FastRoute tries to avoid rip-up and reroute to reduce both wirelength and runtime, the initial tree topology has significant impacts. With the congestion-driven and via-aware topology, the next stage of FastRoute is actual routing. We find that there exists significant potential to improve traditional routing techniques in terms of via control and congestion reduction. The most commonly used routing techniques in global routing include L/Z/U pattern routing, monotonic routing, and maze routing. In addition to new topology and routing techniques, Fast Route integrates several performance enhancement techniques to further improve routing quality and reduce run time."

Designs with a large number of instances (100k or more) can take significantly longer than small designs. 2) the physical area of the design. Designs with large die areas (~1 mm^2 or larger) can take longer because of having to store the die size in memory. 3) improper timing constraints. Designs with excessive timing constaints can cause optimization algorithms, particularly Resizer (rsz) to take excessively long. 4) host machine constraints. Large designs can require a large amount of RAM to run. If the required memory exceeds your machine's available memory, the runtime will be significantly increased. Additionally, OpenROAD scales well with core count, so using a CPU with a greater number of cores can improve runtime."
