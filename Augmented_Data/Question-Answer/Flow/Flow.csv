Brief me on OpenROAD Flow?,"OpenROAD-flow-scripts (ORFS) is a fully autonomous, RTL-GDSII flow for rapid architecture and design space exploration, early prediction of QoR, and detailed physical design implementation. However, ORFS also enables manual intervention for finer user control of individual flow stages through Tcl commands and Python APIs."

"I'm trying to port ORFS to a TSMC process. During the detailed route step, I get a lot of DRT-0073 errors. Utilization is set to 20% at the beginning of the P&R flow and it is a pretty simple design. Give me some tips about what to look into?
I have tried to run the pin_access command directly but the -verbose parameter does not seem to work as I don't get any more information","You can try the developer debugs to get a sense of what is going on. Put detailed_route_debug -pa -pa_markers -pin _3504_:A1 before you call detailed_route and run it in the GUI. It will stop at the pin and show you how it is trying to access it and any associated drc markers. You click the continue button to see the various steps. Hopefully, that gives you an idea as to what is going on. The other option is a support contract with precisioninno.com where we can help under NDA.

What is the difference between Yosys and OpenROAD?,Yosys is a logic synthesis tool which is responsible for transforming register transfer-level (RTL) code into a gate-level netlist. OpenROAD is a place and route (P&R) tool which is responsible for implementing a gale-level netlist into a chip layout. Yosys is developed by the YosysHQ organization whereas OpenROAD is developed by The OpenROAD Project. OpenROAD Flow Scripts (ORFS) makes use of both of these tools (as well as KLayout) to form a full RTL-to-GDS flow.
